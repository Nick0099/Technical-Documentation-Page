        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.It is a small and light weight language. Inside a host environment(for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it withadditional objects; for example:</p>

       <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</br>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p>

        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:<br>With the keyword var. For example,<br>
        <code>var x = 42.</code>
        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br>
        <code>x = 42.</code><br>
        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br> With the keyword let. For example,<br>
        <code>let y = 13</code>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
      </section> 
       <hr>
      </section> <section class="main-section"  id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
       <p> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.<br> JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.<br>
       <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code><br>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
        <br><code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>and Object</li>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
